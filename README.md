This repository hosts two different sites for the skyfi ecosystem:

## üöÄ About Skyfi

Skyfi is a fork of the Bluesky client that allows users to:
- Connect Solana and Ethereum wallets to their Bluesky profile
- Enjoy enhanced social networking with features that leverage a client with a builtin wallet.

Our goal is to attract and inspire developers to bring new ideas to the AT Protocol ecosystem. If you are a designer or a developers, bring your ideas and PRs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Web App (app.skyfi.social)
Built from the `skyfi-social/social-app` repository (Bluesky fork). Our goal is to stay up-to-date with the Blueskay changes to main. We will periodically merge in changes from `main`. (In the early days prior to others working on this project we are using rebase to accomplish this.)

2. Run the "Deploy app.skyfi.social" workflow
3. Specify the branch to deploy (default: "skyfi")

The workflow will:
- Clone the [`skyfi-social/social-app`](https://github.com/skyfi-social/social-app) repo
- Checkout the `skyfi` branch.
- Create a branch with your cool idea. `git checkout -b yourname/cool-idea`
- Install dependencies with `yarn`
- Build the web app with `yarn build-web`
- You should be able to use it by visiting `http://127.0.0.1:19006`
- Commit and push your changes, then submit a PR

#### Deployment
1. The `skyfi` branch is automatically deployed via Cloudflare

### Landing Page (skyfi.social)
Built with:
- HTML5
- Custom CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

#### Local Development
1. Navigate to the `skyfi.social` directory
