# Skyfi - Connecting crypto communities on Bluesky (ATProto)

Skyfi is an open source fork of the Bluesky client focused on features for crypto-curious users and crypto natives.

## üöÄ About Skyfi

The goal of Skyfi is to be a platform for crypto-curious users and crypto natives to experiment and build features on AT Protocol. We aim to attract and inspire developers to bring new ideas to the AT Protocol ecosystem. Whether you're a designer or a developer, bring your ideas and PRs.

Skyfi is a fork of the Bluesky client that allows existing Bluesky users to connect Solana and Ethereum wallets to their Bluesky profile. Login uses OAuth to an existing account, and connecting crypto wallets requires a browser-based wallet extension - tested with Phantom, MetaMask, and Brave wallet.

### Roadmap
- Direct and group messaging based on Skyfi's novel use of encrypted messages over SMTP. (In progress)
- Profile updates to display crypto wallet addresses 
- Send USDC to Skyfi users
- Onboard new users with a built-in native wallet

### Advanced Experimental features
In addition to incremental features on the roadmap, we are also experimenting with more advanced crypto-native features.

#### PDS with wallet-based authentication
Once we have native wallet support in the Skyfi client, we can use this wallet to authenticate with the PDS instead of using a password in the PDS.

#### Farcaster FID as new DID

Farcaster has a robust decentralized ID with an excellent balance of self-custody keys and recoverability when self-custody keys are lost. Farcaster IDs are managed on Optimism, an Ethereum L2, making them censorship-resistant. This change would be very experimental because it is not compatible with the AT Protocol unless endorsed by the Bluesky team.

Bring your ideas for enhanced social networking with features that leverage a Bluesky client with a built-in wallet.
